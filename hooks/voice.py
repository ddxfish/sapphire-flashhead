"""Her voice drives the face.

stream start: pick the face for her current mood and wake her screens. Each
chunk: handed to the server so the face mouths it; the audio is taken (not
played here) only on a lane that plays here and while a viewer plays sound,
so a closed panel never mutes her and a board's voice is never stolen.
Stop: flush what's queued so the face stops when she does; a reply that
ends tells the server so (/end), so a gap between her sentences holds the face
instead of idling it. One line per reply says where her words went.
Only while the server was last seen ready: a stopped or loading service costs
her voice nothing (looked at again at most every 10 s). The server is this
computer's, or in client mode a worker elsewhere (faces.http()).
